[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hseeberger/akka-macro-logging.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hseeberger/akka-macro-logging)

Akka Macro Logging adds support for lightweight logging using [Scala Macros](http://scalamacros.org). It's a thin
wrapper around the logging facilities provided by Akka avoiding unnecessary evaluation of log messages or arguments by
rewriting unchecked invocations of log messages to their checked form:

``` scala
// Simply use `debug` or other log methods without checking whether enabled
log.debug("Invalid foos {}", foos.mkString(", "))

// The macros rewrite the above to
if (log.isDebugEnabled) log.debug("Invalid foos {}", foos.mkString(", "))
```

## Getting Akka SSE

Akka SSE is published to Bintray and Maven Central.

``` scala
// All releases including intermediate ones are published here,
// final ones are also published to Maven Central.
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("hseeberger", "maven")

libraryDependencies ++= List(
  "de.heikoseeberger" %% "akka-macro-logging" % "0.1.0",
  ...
)
```

## Usage â€“ basics

The API uses the same names like the Akka Logging API, i.e. `ActorLogging` and `LoggingAdapter`. So all you have to
change in your code are the imports:

``` scala
import de.heikoseeberger.akkamacrologging._

class MyActor(foos: Set[Foo]) extends ActorLogging {
  log.info("Initialized with {}", foos.mkString(", "))
  ...
}
```
